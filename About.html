      <p>“…whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’ (Matthew 25:40)</p>
      <p>Good Neighbor Ministry is a community of volunteers that brings praise and worship to the residents and patients of nursing homes, senior citizen’s centers and hospitals.  All believers are called to be worshippers of the Lord.  Hence, the ministry’s aim is to bring people into the very presence of the Lord regardless of their circumstances, and our primary purpose is to give God the glory, honor and praise He deserves.</p>
      <p>Good Neighbor Ministry first stepped into a nursing home in June of 1999 with four volunteers, and with God’s amazing grace, we now serve at 24 facilities in Bergen and Passaic County and have over 200 volunteers.  Each hour visit consists of a time of hymnal singing, prayer, and a short message shared from the Bible.</p>
      <p>Good Neighbor Ensemble, a youth musical group within the organization, holds numerous musical performances at the various nursing home sites throughout the year.  Talented student performers come from all over the Bergen County.</p>
      <br>

      <h4><strong>WHY</strong></h4>
      <p>All too often, residents of nursing homes do not experience meaningful worship.  Many of them live in their facilities for years without having the opportunity to become partakers of a worshiping community.  Through Good Neighbor Ministry, however, volunteers bring “church” to them weekly.  Despite having challenges in the past, the ministry has continued to grow and reaches not only the resident, but also the volunteer and the nursing home staff.</p>
      <br>

      <h4><strong>VISION + VALUES</strong></h4>
      <p>“Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.” (Psalm 150:6)</p>
      <p>Good Neighbor Ministry is a non-profit corporation that seeks to provide companionship to the elderly through a time of singing, choruses, musical concerts, conversation and fellowship.  As of April 2017, 24 different facilities throughout Bergen and Passaic County partake in our services.  Nevertheless, should more nursing homes ask for our services, the ministry will strive to meet their needs.</p>
      <p>Good Neighbor Ensemble, a youth musical group within the organization holds weekly musical performances.  Therefore, members of this ensemble must be able to adapt and adjust to the rigor of the performance schedule while maintaining a healthy school life.  Many of the ensemble members are honor students who continue to perform beyond their years at Good Neighbor Ensemble and come back as mentors and performers at benefit concerts all the while learning the importance of serving their community.</p>
      <p>Our mission of service extends beyond the borders of our community.  Through the Good Neighbor Ministry’s annual benefit concerts, we have supported orphanages in Haiti, contributed funds to help the victims of the Nepal earthquake and the Asia tsunami, and assisted refugees from North Korea.  And it is our goal, through our partnerships, to continue to effect positive change in our local and global community.</p>
